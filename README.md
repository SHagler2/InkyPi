## About InkyPi 
InkyPi is an open-source, customizable E-Ink display powered by a Raspberry Pi. Designed for simplicity and flexibility, it allows you to effortlessly display the content you care about, with a simple web interface that makes setup and configuration effortless.

**Features**:
- Natural paper-like aethetic: crisp, minimalist visuals that are easy on the eyes, with no glare or backlight
- Web Interface allows you to update and configure the display from any device on your network
- Minimize distractions: no LEDS, noise, or notifications, just the content you care about
- Easy installation and configuration, perfect for beginners and makers alike
- Open source project allowing you to modify, customize, and create your own plugins
- Set up scheduled playlists to display different plugins at designated times

**Plugins**:

- Image Upload: Upload and display any image from your browser
- Daily Newspaper/Comic: Show daily comics and front pages of major newspapers from around the world
- Clock: Customizable clock faces for displaying time
- AI Image/Text: Generate images and dynamic text from prompts using OpenAI's models
- Weather: Display current weather conditions and multi-day forecasts with a customizable layout
- Calendar: Visualize your calendar from Google, Outlook, or Apple Calendar with customizable layouts

And additional plugins coming soon! For documentation on building custom plugins, see [Building InkyPi Plugins](./docs/building_plugins.md).

See [the wiki](https://github.com/SHagler2/InkyPi/wiki) for a list of community-maintained third-party plugins.

## Hardware 
- Raspberry Pi (4 | 3 | Zero 2 W)
    - Recommended to get 40 pin Pre Soldered Header
- MicroSD Card (min 8 GB)
- E-Ink Display:
    - Inky Impression by Pimoroni (13.3", 7.3", 5.7", 4")
    - Inky wHAT by Pimoroni (4.2")
    - Waveshare e-Paper Displays (Spectra 6, Black and White, various sizes)
        - Note: IT8951-based displays are not supported. See [Waveshare e-Paper](#waveshare-display-support) compatibility for more information.
- Picture Frame or 3D Stand
    - See [community.md](./docs/community.md) for 3D models, custom builds, and other submissions from the community

## Installation
To install InkyPi, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SHagler2/InkyPi.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd InkyPi
    ```
3. Run the installation script with sudo:
    ```bash
    sudo bash install/install.sh [-W <waveshare device model>]
    ``` 
     Option: 
    
    * -W \<waveshare device model\> - specify this parameter **ONLY** if installing for a Waveshare display.  After the -W option specify the Waveshare device model e.g. epd7in3f.

    e.g. for Inky displays use:
    ```bash
    sudo bash install/install.sh
    ```

    and for [Waveshare displays](#waveshare-display-support) use:
    ```bash
    sudo bash install/install.sh -W epd7in3f
    ```


After the installation is complete, the script will prompt you to reboot your Raspberry Pi. Once rebooted, the display will update to show the InkyPi splash screen.

Note: 
- The installation script requires sudo privileges to install and run the service. We recommend starting with a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS to avoid potential conflicts with existing software or configurations.
- The installation process will automatically enable the required SPI and I2C interfaces on your Raspberry Pi.

For more details, including instructions on how to image your microSD with Raspberry Pi OS, refer to [installation.md](./docs/installation.md). You can also checkout [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/L5PvQj1vfC4).

## Update
To update your InkyPi with the latest code changes, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd InkyPi
    ```
2. Fetch the latest changes from the repository:
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
3. Run the update script with sudo:
    ```bash
    sudo bash install/update.sh
    ```
This process ensures that any new updates, including code changes and additional dependencies, are properly applied without requiring a full reinstallation.

## Uninstall
To install InkyPi, simply run the following command:

```bash
sudo bash install/uninstall.sh
```

## Roadmap
The InkyPi project is constantly evolving, with many exciting features and improvements planned for the future.

- Plugins, plugins, plugins
- Modular layouts to mix and match plugins
- Support for buttons with customizable action bindings
- Improved Web UI on mobile devices

## Waveshare Display Support

Waveshare offers a range of e-Paper displays, similar to the Inky screens from Pimoroni, but with slightly different requirements. While Inky displays auto-configure via the inky Python library, Waveshare displays require model-specific drivers from their [Python EPD library](https://github.com/waveshareteam/e-Paper/tree/master/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/lib/waveshare_epd).

This project has been tested with several Waveshare models. **Displays based on the IT8951 controller are not supported**, and **screens smaller than 4 inches are not recommended** due to limited resolution.

If your display model has a corresponding driver in the link above, it’s likely to be compatible. When running the installation script, use the -W option to specify your display model (without the .py extension). The script will automatically fetch and install the correct driver.
